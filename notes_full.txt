00:00 Start work

Trying to reproduce the figures, figure 3 is the first do-able one.

00:30; Matlab is currently packaging the binaries
00:38; Done binaries starting packaging
01:38; Just finished installing VMWare, Windows 10, licenses and drivers
01:55; Finally got shared folders working, installed the matlab package and ran figures 2&3. Worked perfectly.

01:18; Made main.m script, started packaging everything.
01:28; Tested first packages, turns out main.m didn't include the other script while packaging.
02:21; Included all the required files but still doesn't work for some reason. Gets stuck at the end of the first program. Doesn't move on/give the output.
03:12; Finished packaging and uploading.

03:15; Testing matlab packages with different versions
06:15; Started working on Matlab to produce figure 3 of the Julia article

06:20; Still working on Matlab code. Reading up on possible ways to recreate plots using the matlab documentation
10:20; Looks like the colored plots could be done using a heatmap
14:20; Still trying to figure out what the 3rd/function variable could be in addition to the 2 axes.
16:20; Found some example from their github code commit comments!!!!!! Will try on thursday

16:30; Trying their sample code

F3 (6) 
[138(76.24%)]@22:30

22:30; Been trying to modify their code in order to save all the plots after numbering and naming.
27:30; Able to save all plots. Also managed to figure out the correct colorscheme and axes.

28:15; Working on the other plots for Julia
30:15; Writing a python regex script that takes in result.txt and extracts all the required values for the tables
32:33; Python regex script
36:00; Finished with all the basic stuff needed for extracting!

===========================================
Adding Travis.

00:00:00: Starting adding travis.
00:28:00: Basic travis file complete, Now verifying that the test suite is running.
00:30:00: Basic test suite now running.
